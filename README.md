Infovip project
===============

The project aims to develop a framework that allows rapid development of web 
applications with minimal effort. In fact, I started writing a social media 
website in PHP, but it happened a long time ago (more than 8 years), so I made 
a decision and started to create a completely new project. The goal of the 
project is not only to create a social media website, but also to create a 
content management system, which enables you to build a powerful online applications 
in a short period of time. I also would like to create a module management 
system which makes developers' life much easier, and allows a much better automated 
testing and module management.

I am planning to implement a lot of features. The previous 
version of the project includes a lot of features, and the use of these features 
lead to a complicated system, and just makes the system difficult for the users. 
Therefore, I will design a universal search engine in the new version.

In this version, the permission management system will be much more precise.
Basically, each user will have a profile page, which will be fully configurable,
The basic objective of the site is to create a new form of communication that 
allows people to get to know other people using the services of the site.

In addition, a new universal timeline will be implemented that allows the user to 
be always updated with other people's activities.

I uploaded a very alpha version of the project that includes only the basics of 
the project which is still under development but the new versions might be 
continously pushed into the repository, it depends on my free time.

At this time, the project only contains some basic element to test the basic framework.

The project itself is a Maven project with three modules and a lot of other dependencies. 

The modules are divided in the following categories :
-----------------------------------------------------
    - elasticsearch (Contains templates)
    - infovip-ear (Enterprise Application , ejb, and web modules are packaged into this module)
    - infovip-ejb (EJB module)
    - infovip-web (Web module)
    
There will be a db directory which will contain the structure of database that is used by the application.
Also contact me if you noticed any errors or typos and I will fix it.
