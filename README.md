Infovip project
===============

The project aims to develop a framework that allows rapid development of web applications with minimal effort. 
In fact, I started writing a social media website in PHP but it happened a long time ago (more than 8 years), 
so I made a decision and started to create a completely new project.

Infovip is not just a framework but also a social media site as well.

I uploaded a very alpha version of the project that includes only the basics of the project which
is still under development and the new versions might be continously pushed into the repository.

At this time, the project only contains some basic element to test how the framework is working.

Please contact me directly if you feel you are interested in joining this project and if you want to help in development.

Also contact me if you noticed any errors or typos and I will fix it.

For more information please see the project's wiki page.
